# Laurent for Home Assistant

[In Russian](README_ru.md)

This integration provides support for some of [KernelChip] devices.

## Usage

Install it as [Custom repository] within HACS and activate it from UI. You've to provide unique name for your device,
host and password (passwordless access is not supported).

Поддерживается настройка через UI (ConfigFlow), нужно указать хост и пароль от устройства.

## Roadmap

I've made this integration for my only KernelChip's device ([Laurent-112]). According to documentation, this integration may also support [Laurent-128] but I haven't tested it. I don't have any plans supporting other devices.

You may send PR to provide support for other devices, or just fork it.
